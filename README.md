### The Hilariously Unpredictable Image Monk Gallery

- Inspired by the delightful chaos of the [Masonry Grid](https://masonry.desandro.com/), and a dash of monkey business!

### Elevating the Interactive Image Gallery Game

- I wanted image gallery to be a bit more lively than 'Monk' gallery. That's why text magically appears when you hover over the images!

### Sprucing Up with Style! üíÉ

- When it comes to those delightful sublinks emerging from `/about`, we're giving the page a makeover that's cleaner than a freshly laundered superhero cape. What does that mean? We're keeping it as simple as a sidekick's sidekick until we've decided on our grand style and layout reveal! Stay tuned for the fashion show!

model Owner {
  id           String      @id @default(uuid())
  name         String
  Quote        Quote?      @relation(fields: [quoteId], references: [id])
  quoteId      String?
  LifeLesson   LifeLesson? @relation(fields: [lifeLessonId], references: [id])

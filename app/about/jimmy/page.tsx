      1. My Journey as a Buddhist Monk in Thailand I had a unique experience
      during my time as a monk in Thailand, which left a lasting impact on my
      life. I found myself at two distinct types of temples, one nestled within
      the bustling city and the other hidden deep within the tranquil forest.
      The reason behind this spiritual journey was deeply rooted in Thai
      culture; it&apos;s a tradition for boys with at least one parent from
      Thailand to seek ordination as a monk. It&apos;s a way for us to apologize
      to our parents for any pain we might have caused them throughout the years
      and to express our heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifices they&apos;ve
      made on our behalf. 2. My Path to Graduation in 2019: A Tech Enthusiast
      with a Purpose In 2017, I embarked on an educational journey that led me
      to graduate in 2019. I chose this path not only because I believe
      it&apos;s the future but also because I yearned to work on applications
      that could truly make a difference for each user. I was motivated by a
      desire to solve real-world problems, whether it was simplifying the
      process of moving from point A to point B or being a part of a solution
      that addresses the environmental challenges we face today. Technology, to
      me, is a tool for creating positive change. 3. Balancing Life: From the
      Outdoors to Family and Friends In my private life, I find solace in the
      great outdoors. There&apos;s nothing quite like setting up my 4-season
      tent in the midst of a winter wilderness and simply being one with nature.
      I also have a passion for calisthenics, pushing my physical limits to
      achieve personal growth. Taking cold baths when the opportunity arises is
      another invigorating pursuit. However, my heart belongs to my family,
      which includes my wife and two older children. They are my anchor, and I
      relish every moment spent with them. And when they&apos;ve had their fill
      of my company, I cherish the times I spend with friends, often meeting up
      at a restaurant for a hearty burger and a refreshing beer. It&apos;s in
      these moments that I truly appreciate the balance of my life, from
      introspective solitude to the joy of companionship.
